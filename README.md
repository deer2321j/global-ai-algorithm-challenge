# global-ai-algorithm-challenge
This project independently generates recommendation results through multiple sub-models, and finally adopts a "two-layer weighted voting" method for fusion to form the submission file. The training and prediction of each sub-model are completed within their respective directories, and the fusion script runs in the project root directory.
